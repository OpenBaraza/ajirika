# 🧭 Project Ajirika — Building a Standard for the Data CV
Hiring has evolved — from handwritten letters and printed CVs, to email attachments, and now to online job application portals.
These portals have made life easier for HR teams — but for applicants, each submission still takes time and effort to re-enter the same details over and over again.
**Project Ajirika** is starting a conversation around this.
> 💡 *What if we had a standard data structure for job applications — where an applicant could upload one structured “data CV” that any portal could read?*
This would:
- Save time for applicants  
- Ensure accuracy across job submissions  
- Make job matching more efficient  
- Enable AI-assisted CV writing and job matching

## 🎯 Our Goals
1. **Reusable JSON CV Format**  
   Create a portable, machine-readable `JSON` CV format that applicants can use across multiple job portals.
2. **Unified CV Platform**  
   Build a central open-source platform for job seekers to update, export, and share their CVs in the standard format.
3. **HR Standardization**  
   Collaborate with the HR community in Kenya to standardize key CV data fields and metadata.
4. **Open Source Development**  
   Foster an active open-source community to evolve the schema and tools continuously.
